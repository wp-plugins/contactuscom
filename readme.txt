Our web app also has additional customization options for admins who are creating a contact form, and we’re always adding new features to make your lead generation and contact management efforts easier and more effective.

We have premium (paid) plans with advanced features, but our standared features are always free.

**Multiple Form Type Management**
ContactUs.com provides all sorts of conversion optimized, high performance forms. Up until version 3.4, the Contact Form by ContactUs.com plugin would only manage Contact Forms, but now the plugin can manage all of the great form types ContactUs.com has to offer.  Easy Appointments form, fast Donation form and high conversion Newsletter Signup forms are all now available through quick setup wizards and short codes. 

**Flexible Contact Forms with Clients Across the World**
The contact form plugin can be used for multiple uses such as: simple “Contact Us” contact form, Support contact form, a Price Quote Contact Form, Demo Request contact form, Newsletter signup form, “Advertise with Us” contact form, a Customer Feedback contact form, Request a Consultation  contact form, and a Suggestion form. Using a custom form field template, you’ll be able to add or modify the form fields you need using our drag-and-drop editor.

Contact forms powered by the plugin are currently used by lawyers, doctors, wedding vendors, real estate agents, home contractors, online stores, offline retail, insurance agents, web software companies, independent consultants, marketing agencies, advertising agencies, PR agencies, tour operators, florists, writers, designers, tutors, bands and musicians, accountants, financial planners, church groups, non-profits, blogs, web publishers, and many different types of websites. They are used to capture general inquiries, submit quote requests, schedule meeting/consultations/demos, solicit feedback, signup to services, or otherwise generate leads.

**Our Floating Tab and Quick Install Shortcodes**
The most popular implementation of the contact form plugin places a callout tab overlay onto the margins of your website so that it’s visible on every page. The callout contact form tab, using “Contact Us” as the default text (although there are options for additional text), opens up the hosted contact form created by this plugin. (More about our contact form callout tabs [here](http://www.contactus.com/callout-tabs/) ). Use this method if you’re using your contact form to proactively generate inquiries or prospects from your website because it’ll get your form seen by more of your website visitors. Users can select different contact form and callout tab design. Specifically for WordPress, WordPress Developers can also place a shortcodes on specific pages or posts to embed the contact form.

**More Advanced Placements:**
* **Inline:** Websites looking for basic contact forms to capture general website inquiries.
* **Hyperlink**: This placement type is for webmasters. It enable hyperlinks on text, images or actions on your website used to trigger your ContactUs.com form. See examples of this placement type here.
* **Exit Event**: This placement is included with the premium version for ContactUs and automatically loads the form in front of users who are about to bounce. Use this placement if you are using your website for marketing and lead-generation purposes.

You can manage even more customizations for your contact form from inside your ContactUs.com account admin panel, which is easy to navigate to from inside your plugin. The customization options include form content such as the header, sub-header, button text and website info. Also, from your ContactUs.com account admin panel, you’ll be able to manage your delivery options for your contact form, whether to direct form signups to an email address, receive an SMS alert, or post inquiry information to over twenty 3rd party software tools like MailChimp, Zoho, Hubspot and Google Docs.

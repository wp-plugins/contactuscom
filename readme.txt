== Description ==

**Generate new customer leads for your business by adding an advanced Contact Form powered by ContactUs.com onto your WordPress website**

The ContactUs.com Form+ plugin for WordPress is a powerful contact form alternative for websites looking to generate new business. ContactUs.com offers an advanced and complete solution for individuals or companies aiming to improve the way that they generate new customers from their website. The plugin is free and makes it easy to add ContactUs.com to your WordPress website. For the plugin to work, you must have an active ContactUs.com account (available for free) to configure and publish your form plus to access your lead management system.

Our ContactUs.com Form+ solution offers:

* Easy implementation
* Auto responder
* Lead notification emails
* Lead tracking and reports
* Mobile optimized form
* Form analytics

The ContactUs.com form is more than a simple contact form solution. Instead of plugging directly into the website, Contact Form+ places a "Contact Us" button tab on all website pages, and opens a configurable form as a frame on top of the WordPress site.

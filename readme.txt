Add a flexible contact form to your website. Built with ContactUs.com’s cloud-based software. Customize to build beautiful, functional contact forms

== Description ==

In less than five minutes, you can be up and running with a simple yet powerful contact form on your WordPress website that is powered by ContactUs.com. This contact form plugin is integrated with ContactUs.com’s customer acquisition software suite, built to help you track and prioritize your contact form submissions. The plugin comes with a free, secure account registration, used to manage your form settings, software integrations and contact form submissions. The plugin makes it simple to create your first form. 

**Summary of Contact Forms created via ContactUs.com:**

- **Contact Form Design:** Contact forms can be created with several basic designs. Premium users can add custom background images or choose from premium design templates.
- **Form Fields:** Standard forms have basic contact fields. Websites with more specific needs can select a Custom Field option (within the ContactUs.com admin panel) and use our online drag-and-drop form editor combined with our form designs designated as custom field templates to build a custom contact form, quote form, request form, feedback forms, or any other type of contact form you need for your website.
- **Contact Form Placement:** Our standard implementation places a callout tab onto your website (which you can move around to your preferred position), which is used to load an in-browser pop-up of your form. We find that this contact form placement is the most flexible for implementation, and maximizes the visibility of your contact form to your website visitors. Plugin provides short-code support for advanced WordPress users looking for more flexible form placements.
- **Content:** Add customized form content (headline, field labels, submission button), social media links, “About Us” text and Google Maps.  Additionally, you can customize your confirmation page text.
- **Auto-Responder:** You can customize the auto-responder text and settings in your ContactUs.com profile.Submission Requirements: Inside of your ContactUs.com profile, you can manage your CAPTCHA settings to fight against spam (only if spam is a problem for you– by default, it’s turned off) and “Agree to Terms” disclaimers to fulfill any legal requirements.
- **Contact Form Notifications:** Form submissions, by default, will be delivered to the email address used to create your ContactUs.com profile. You can control these settings in your ContactUs.com admin panel. Premium users can receive SMS notifications.
- **Integration with 3rd Party Software:** ContactUs.com provides a basic level of integration with 3rd party software providers. Once enabled (in your ContactUs.com account), you can direct the signups to 3rd party apps like MailChimp, Constant Contact, Google Docs, Sendy, SugarCRM, and many more.
- **Google Analytics:** Advanced users can integrate Google Analytics codes on the contact form view and form submission.

Once your ContactUs.com profile is created, you’ll have one-click access to the ContactUs.com form builder (outside of the plugin) for most of the powerful customization options including: form fields, design, form content, social media links and Google Maps.  You’ll be able to customize your auto-responder, confirmation page and callout tab. When you use our contact form solution, you can also get alerts via SMS, email or Starting with Version 3.5, you are also able to add and manage multiple ContactUs.com forms using the Contact Form plugin by ContactUs.com.
